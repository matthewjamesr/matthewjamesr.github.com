It is my hope that this post helps others as I am an average person, not even a \u0026ldquo;non-elite\u0026rdquo; runner as some influencers would like to term themselves.\nBackground It is no secret that I am in the U.S. Air Force (Google me, go ahead). Having joined in 2010, running and fitness in general was not a focus of my childhood household. I never failed a physical fitness test - but there were close calls. For a solid 12 years of service I did what I thought worked with little additional research: consistent long slow runs. Every time. Routine started getting boring with little increase in performance. The second time I was stationed in the Republic of Korea, I decided it was time for change. I registered for multiple races from 5 kms up to half-marathons. The following is what I have used thus far and how it has worked for me.\nPurposeful Training When I arrived back to Korea, I decided I wanted to do something different. I wanted to set a goal that would be a real challenge. After meeting new friends and surrounding myself with other like-minded runners, I set off on my first purposeful training program. My first half-marathon would be the DMZ Peace Marathon (DMZ 평화마라톤) near Paju City. The training was hard but it paid off.\nDMZ Peace Marathon: Strava Results\nTraining Peaks My Training Peaks dashboard\nI credit my ability to cross the finish line of my first half-marathon to Training Peaks. For the DMZ Peace Marathon half-marathon I used a six week crash-course. I loved the training experience so much that I also bought a 18 week training plan to attempt a new personal best - six months later. Anddddd\u0026hellip;. crushed it! My new PB was about 12 minutes faster.\nSeoul Race: Strava Results\nAfter Seoul Race, I decided to take a small break and enjoy cycling and more time with my family. Fast-forward to mid-January, 2025, and I committed mentally to a full marathon with a coworker. Like before, I started with another Training Peaks-based approach. This time, however, I found it too easy and not varied enough. I could have switched plans but to be honest, I wanted to try something different.\nRunna Runna has been extremely popular within the running influencer space with major YouTuber\u0026rsquo;s that I routinely watch commenting on it. Being a developer and fan of artificial intelligence, I said \u0026ldquo;why not\u0026rdquo;. After installing, selecting my goals and inputing my recent personal bests, a \u0026ldquo;tailored\u0026rdquo; plan was generated complete with endurance runner-focused strength workouts. What really impressed was the variety of runs generated: short easy runs, long easy runs, tempo sessions, intervals, and my favorite - progression runs. Three weeks in and I am loving the experience.\nRunna: Assessed improvement over time\nWill I accomplish the stated paces by time Chuncheon Marathon rolls around in October, 2025? That is uncertain. However, I feel great and can tell tha plan is working with dips in average resting heart rate, average zone two heart rate, and VO2 max increases.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/committing-to-my-first-full-marathon/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a marathon, not a sprint.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaid some endurance coach somewhere.
